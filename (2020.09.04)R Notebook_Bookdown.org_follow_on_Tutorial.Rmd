The very original version of Markdown was invented mainly to write HTML content more easily. For example, you can write a bullet with - text instead of the verbose HTML code <ul><li>text</li></ul>, or a quote with > text instead of <blockquote>text</blockquote>.

The syntax of Markdown has been greatly extended by Pandoc. What is more, Pandoc makes it possible to convert a Markdown document to a large variety of output formats. In this chapter, we will introduce the features of various document output formats. In the next two chapters, we will document the presentation formats and other R Markdown extensions, respectively.

#### PANDOC
Pandoc is a free and open-source document converter, widely used as a writing tool and as a basis for publishing workflows. It was created by John MacFarlane, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Berkeley



## 3.1 HTML document
As we just mentioned before, Markdown was originally designed for HTML output, so it may not be surprising that the HTML format has the richest features among all output formats. 
We recommend that you read this full section before you learn other output formats, because other formats have several features in common with the HTML document format, and we will not repeat these features in the corresponding sections.

To create an HTML document from R Markdown, you specify the html_document output format in the YAML metadata of your document:

(putting dashes in quotations to avoid erroneous formatting)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
